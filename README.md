As part of my internship in "Machine Learning" I created a SPAM SMS DETECTION, Credit Card Fraud Detection, Movie Genre Classification AI models. 

SPAM SMS DETECTION

I Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

I Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Thanks Codsoft for this opportunity.
