SPAM SMS DETECTION

As part of my internship in "Machine Learning" i created a SPAM SMS DETECTION AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. 
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

Thanks Codsoft for this opportunity.
